        <p>Katherine Vissering "Kitty" Oppenheimer (nee Puening; August 8, 1910 - October 27, 1972) was a German American biologist, botanist, and a member of the Communist Party of America until leaving in the 1930s. Her husbands were Frank Ramseyer, Joe Dallet, Richard Stewart Harrison, and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II.</p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Katherine Vissering "Kitty" Puening was born in Recklinghausen, Westphalia, Prussia, Germany, on August 8, 1910, the only child of Franz Puening and Kathe Vissering. Although she claimed that her father was a prince and that her mother was related to Queen Victoria, these claims were untrue. Her mother was, in fact, a cousin of Wilhelm Keitel, who later became a field marshal in the German Army during World War II, and was hanged in 1946.</p>

        <p>At a New Year's Eve party later that year, Puening met Joseph Dallet Jr. After the 1927 executions of Sacco and Vanzetti, he joined the Communist Party of America in 1929. He had been involved in the International Unemployment Day protest in Chicago on March 6, 1930, that was brutally repressed by the authorities, and worked as a union organizer with the steel workers in Youngstown, Ohio. At one point Dallet unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Youngstown on the Communist Party ticket.</p>

        <h2>Marriage with Oppenheimer</h2>
        <p>Soon after, Harrison left for Pasadena, California, for his residency at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), while Kitty remained in Philadelphia to complete her bachelor's degree in botany at the University of Pennsylvania, and was then offered a postgraduate research fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles. At Caltech, she worked with physicist Charles Lauritsen: the X-ray laboratory at Caltech used for physics research was also used for experimental cancer therapy research. It was at a garden party thrown by Lauritsen and his wife Sigrid in August 1939 that she met Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who taught at Caltech for part of each year and the remaining time at University of California, Berkeley. Soon after, they began an affair, one which they did not even attempt to conceal: they were frequently seen around town in Robert's car. At Christmas time she went to Berkeley without her husband, to spend time with Oppenheimer.</p>

        <p>Oppenheimer invited Harrison and Kitty to spend the summer at his New Mexico ranch, Perro Caliente. Harrison declined, as he was engaged in his research, but Kitty accepted. Robert Serber and his wife Charlotte collected Kitty in Pasadena, and drove her to Perro Caliente, where they met up with Robert, his brother Frank Oppenheimer, and his wife Jackie. The Serbers had met Kitty before, at Charlotte Serber's parents' house in Philadelphia in 1938. The Serbers loved to ride through the pine and aspen forests and floral meadows of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, camping with minimal food and equipment. Kitty impressed them with her riding ability; horsemanship was a normal accomplishment for women of her social class, and she had learned to ride as a girl on the riding trails around Aspinwall. Kitty and Robert rode out to stay the night with his friend Katy Page in Los Pinos, New Mexico. The following day Page rode to Perro Caliente on her bay horse to return Kitty's nightgown, which had been left under Robert's pillow.</p>

        <p>Their child, a son they named Peter, was born in Pasadena, on May 12, 1941, during Oppenheimer's regular session at Caltech. When they returned to Berkeley, he bought a new house at One Eagle Hill with a view over the Golden Gate. Kitty worked at the University of California as a laboratory assistant. They left Peter with the Chevaliers and a German nurse and headed out to Perro Caliente for the summer. The holiday was marred when Oppenheimer was trampled by a horse, and Kitty injured her leg when she hit a car in front of her while driving their Cadillac convertible. The United States entered World War II in December 1941, and Oppenheimer began recruiting staff for the Manhattan Project. Among the first were the Serbers, who moved into the apartment over the garage at One Eagle Hill.</p>

        <p>On March 16, 1943, the couple boarded a train for Santa Fe, New Mexico. By the end of the month, they had moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where they occupied one of the buildings formerly belonging to the Los Alamos Ranch School. Los Alamos was known to the occupants as "the Hill" and to the Manhattan Project as Site Y. Oppenheimer became the director of Project Y. Kitty abdicated the role of post commander's wife to Martha Parsons, the wife of Robert's deputy, Navy Captain William S. Parsons. She put her biologist training to use working for the director of the Health Group at Los Alamos, Louis Hempelmann, conducting blood tests to assess the danger of radiation.</p>
